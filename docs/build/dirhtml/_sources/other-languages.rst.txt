The alpha version of Hyperkite officially only supports Python.

To use Hyperkite in combination with other programming languages, we recommend you to wrap the Python interface. Alternatively, Hyperkite can be accessed directly through a REST API. However, the API has not been officially documented, so we recommend you to take a look in the `source code`_ to find the required http requests.
