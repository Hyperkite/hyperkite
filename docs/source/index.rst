Hyperkite_ is a parameter optimization tool designed to efficiently optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning models, such as gradient boosted trees or deep neural networks. The tool is designed to optimize hyperparameters using the most powerful algorithms in a flexible and simple way. The platform supports parallel execution of experiments without any modifications, is easily extendable, and includes a range of optional alternative optimization algorithms out-of-the-box. Furthermore, the tool offers an easy interface to manage machine learning experiments.
